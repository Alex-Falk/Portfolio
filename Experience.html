            <h1>Iron Harvest (2020)</h1>

            </p>
            <p>
                While working on Iron Harvest I was part of a small team focused on improving units and implementing new abilities for them. To achieve this we disected the units in meetings and discussed how they can be improved by code, design, animation, vfx and sfx. This allowed me to then implement new features and units in close collaboration with the other teams. We also created abilities for units from the ground up for the upcoming expansion for Iron Harvest, as well as overhauling systems such as how infantry aim. We continued with these improvements for the live patches after the official release date of 1st September 2020. During this project I gained experience working with Unity3D and C#.

                As a Junior Game Mechanics Programmer at Tt Games I mostly worked on "Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga" for which I took responsibility of implementing the physics based "The Force" game mechanic as well as some smaller features like an edge highlighting system to manage which objects are highlighted by which colour. My work at Tt Games involved using C++ and an in house game engine.

                During my initial months at Tt Games I was bug fixing in various systems of the game Lego Worlds. These bug fixes were not integrated into the live version of the game, but the systems were used in "The Lego Movie 2 Videogame", gaining me a credit in that title.
