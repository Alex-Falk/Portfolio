							<h1>Alexander Falk</h1>
							<p>
								MSc Computer Games Enginnering student.<br>
								MPhys Astrophysics graduate.<br>
								I first decided to get into games engineering due to my passion for both video games and programming. <br>
								I have been playing video games my entire life and always enjoyed programming throughout my education.

									<h2>Advanced Graphics for Games</h2>
									<p>In this course I was introduced to different techniques for graphics programming. The coursework required me to create three scenes of my choosing to show off some of these effects. I used C++ and OpenGL (using and expanding the provided NCLGL framework) for this project</p>

									<h2>GPU Accelerated Soft-Body</h2>
									<p>In my "Advanced Game Tech" module one of the advanced tasks was to create a GPU accelerated soft-body. I created this using a set of points connected to each other by springs. Both the spring interactions and the other physics acting on the particles (colissions with other objects and gravity) are calculated on the GPU. For this project i used C++ and the NCLGL framework from the graphics course.</p>

									<h2>Advanced Game Tech - Networking and AI</h2>
									<p>This is part of my coursework for the Advanced Game Tech module. The video here shows a server running with 3 clients connecting to it. The server does the calculations such as pathfinding, maze creation and AI and sends it to the clients for them to render. The client has a point and click interface to choose starting and end positions for it's avatar (green cube).  The hazards (red cubes) are control by a Finite State Machine. Collisions can be detected between avatars and hazards.</p>

									<h2>Fast Prototyping of a game using the Unreal Engine</h2>
									<p>For one of my modules i was tasked with creating a fast prototype of basic features of a game. The basic idea of the game was to create a game where a ball would paint any parts of the enviroment it touches. Further suggestions were the use of pickups and multiplayer.</p>

									<h2>Team Project - 'El Bloob' - Painting game</h2>
									<p>The task for the team project for my MSc was to create a multiplayer game in which players "paint" the environment with colours. My roles in the project included: Implement Networking and port other features to work with the network, Doing all git merges and fixing related problems, creating a particle effect (using a compute shader), working on a graphical effect for a 'wavy' liquid, creating a score system, doing QA and bugfixing.</p>

							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<p>I am MSc Computer Games Engineering student, and Mphys Astrophysics graduate who is passionate about games and programming. I am currently looking for opportunities in the video games industry startin in April 2018. I am hoping to get a placement at which I can write my Master's dissertation.</p>
							<p>Due to my background in Astrophysics I have a lot of experience in physics and maths (such as linear algebra). The Mphys degree also taught me many useful skills, such as problem solving and critical thinking. During that degree I also did a large amount of programming, mostly in python, but also in Java, C and Haskell. During this degree I developed a passion for programming. This combined with my passion for video games is the reason why I started the MSc in Games Engineering.</p>
							<p>In the Games degree I have already developed a large amount of skills, such as a proficiency in C++ programming as well as in Graphics programming and Game Tech. I have especially enjoyed the modules on Graphics and Physics.</p>
