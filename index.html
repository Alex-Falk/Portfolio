							<h1>Alexander Falk</h1>
							<p>
								Junior Game Mechanics Programmer.<br>
								Msc Game Engineering (distinction) and MPhys Astrophysics graduate.<br>
								I first decided to get into games engineering due to my passion for both video games and programming. <br>
								I have been playing video games my entire life and always enjoyed programming throughout my education.

									<h2>Advanced Graphics for Games</h2>
									<p>In this course I was introduced to different techniques for graphics programming. The coursework required me to create three scenes of my choosing to show off some of these effects. I used C++ and OpenGL (using and expanding the provided NCLGL framework) for this project</p>

									<h2>GPU Accelerated Soft-Body</h2>
									<p>In my "Advanced Game Tech" module one of the advanced tasks was to create a GPU accelerated soft-body. I created this using a set of points connected to each other by springs. Both the spring interactions and the other physics acting on the particles (colissions with other objects and gravity) are calculated on the GPU. For this project i used C++ and the NCLGL framework from the graphics course.</p>

									<h2>Advanced Game Tech - Networking and AI</h2>
									<p>This is part of my coursework for the Advanced Game Tech module. The video here shows a server running with 3 clients connecting to it. The server does the calculations such as pathfinding, maze creation and AI and sends it to the clients for them to render. The client has a point and click interface to choose starting and end positions for it's avatar (green cube).  The hazards (red cubes) are control by a Finite State Machine. Collisions can be detected between avatars and hazards.</p>

									<h2>Fast Prototyping of a game using the Unreal Engine</h2>
									<p>For one of my modules i was tasked with creating a fast prototype of basic features of a game. The basic idea of the game was to create a game where a ball would paint any parts of the enviroment it touches. Further suggestions were the use of pickups and multiplayer.</p>

									<h2>Team Project - 'El Bloob' - Painting game</h2>
									<p>The task for the team project for my MSc was to create a multiplayer game in which players "paint" the environment with colours. My roles in the project included: Implement Networking and port other features to work with the network, Doing all git merges and fixing related problems, creating a particle effect (using a compute shader), working on a graphical effect for a 'wavy' liquid, creating a score system, doing QA and bugfixing.</p>

							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<p>I am a video games programmer with proffesional experience in programming game mechanics in C++. I am passionate about creating great games. I have been working in the industry since April 2018 and have since then worked on "Lego Worlds" (leading to a credit in "The Lego Movie 2 Video Game" which was based on Lego Worlds tech) as well as "Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga" which is announced to be released in 2020. I have learned a lot of things at this position and have grown my knowledge of C++ and games programming.</p>
							<p>I have some personal experience with Unreal Engine 4 and Unity3D. Mainly I have used UE4 to prototype a game during my university degree, as well as using it for a gamejam.</p>
							<p>Due to my background in Astrophysics I have profficiency in physics and maths (such as linear algebra). The Mphys degree also taught me a number of useful skills, such as problem solving and critical thinking. Throughout the degree I made use of Python and Java for several projects, which is was originally sparked my passion for programming. This combined with my passion for video games, that i have had ever since I was playing "Age of Empires" at the age of 5, is the reason why I decided to work in the games industry.</p>
							<p>My Game Engineering degree taught me valuable game programming skills such as modern C++, rendering with OpenGL, physics engine architecture and networking.</p>
